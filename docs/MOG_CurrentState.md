# MOG — Current Project State

The running snapshot of where this codebase is *right now*. Updated at the end of every session that ships material changes. Future Claude reads this on session start (via `CLAUDE.md` @-import) and uses it to orient before touching anything.

If this doc and `CLAUDE.md` conflict on a specific fact, `CLAUDE.md` wins for structure / invariants; this doc wins for "what's currently in flight."

## Pinned focus

**No active in-flight work.** The 2026-05-24 session landed two big deliverables: the repo consolidation (Master-Ordering-Guide merged into mog-mobile + clasp deploy workflow) AND the Claude Code scaffold itself. Both are complete.

### Next-session candidates (impact-ranked)

1. **Decommission `Master-Ordering-Guide` GitHub repo** (~2026-05-31, one week after consolidation lands). Delete the repo on GitHub and rename the local folder to `.archive`. Low effort, removes a foot-gun.
2. **Stress-test the deploy workflow with a real code change.** Pick a tiny improvement (a typo fix in `apps-script/HowToUse.html`, a CSS tweak in `template/index.html`), push it through the full edit→deploy→smoke-test loop. Confirms the workflow is real, not just paper.
3. **Sebastian's outstanding PWA backlog** (when surfaced) — anything in `template/index.html` that's been waiting for the consolidation to finish. Currently unknown; ask at session start.
4. **Service worker `CACHE_VERSION` bump audit.** Both `sw.js` (hub) and `template/sw.js` are currently at `v5`. Confirm no pending shell changes need a bump.

---

## Standing invariants (carry forward)

Duplicated from `CLAUDE.md` so this doc reads standalone:

1. Never edit generated `<slug>/` dirs — overwritten by `build.py`.
2. Never edit code in the Apps Script editor — overwritten by `deploy.ps1`.
3. `.gs` files are identical across all 9 deploy targets; per-store config lives in spreadsheet data.
4. Apps Script HTML modals run in Rhino (ES5) — no arrow fn / `let` / `const` / template literals.
5. `template/index.html` placeholders (`__MOG_API_URL__`, `__MOG_THEME__`, `__MOG_APPLE_TOUCH_ICON__`) appear exactly once each; never replace by hand.
6. `STORE_REGISTRY` line in root `index.html` is build-injected; edit `stores.json` instead.
7. Bump `CACHE_VERSION` when shipping shell changes so KMs' phones evict stale caches.
8. Slugs in `stores.json` are immutable once published (bookmark/home-screen breakage).

## Deploy targets (apps-script/.clasp-targets.json)

9 targets total. Code is identical across all of them; `appsscript.json` manifest is unified to rpr's (which explicitly declares OAuth scopes).

| Slug | Store | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_template` | Master template | Copied to seed new stores. Push keeps it current. |
| `rpr` | Roll Play - Rosslyn BOH | Canary target — first to receive new deploys for smoke testing. |
| `rprfo` | Roll Play - Rosslyn FOH | |
| `rpt` | Roll Play - Tysons BOH | |
| `rptfo` | Roll Play - Tysons FOH | Added 2026-05-24. |
| `rpfr` | Roll Play - Founders BOH | |
| `rpfrf` | Roll Play - Founders FOH | Added 2026-05-24. |
| `tnyt` | Teas'n You - Tysons BOH | |
| `tnytf` | Teas'n You - Tysons FOH | |

Deploy command from `apps-script/`: `.\deploy.ps1` (all), `.\deploy.ps1 -Target <slug>` (one), `.\deploy.ps1 -DryRun` (preview).

---

## Live stores (stores.json)

8 entries — the master template isn't published to the PWA hub (it has no deployment URL because it isn't deployed as a web app).

| Slug | URL | Concept | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rpr` | `sebheh.github.io/mog-mobile/rpr/` | Roll Play | Rosslyn BOH |
| `rprfo` | `.../rprfo/` | Roll Play | Rosslyn FOH |
| `rpt` | `.../rpt/` | Roll Play | Tysons BOH |
| `rptfo` | `.../rptfo/` | Roll Play | Tysons FOH |
| `rpfr` | `.../rpfr/` | Roll Play | Founders BOH |
| `rpfrf` | `.../rpfrf/` | Roll Play | Founders FOH |
| `tnyt` | `.../tnyt/` | Teas'n You | Tysons BOH |
| `tnytf` | `.../tnytf/` | Teas'n You | Tysons FOH |

## Open issues / risks

- **Master-Ordering-Guide repo still exists** at `github.com/SebHEH/Master-Ordering-Guide` and locally at `C:\Users\RAD-SEB\Documents\GitHub\Master-Ordering-Guide\`. Scheduled for deletion ~2026-05-31. Risk: someone (or future-Claude) opens a session from the old dir and edits stale files, splitting the source-of-truth again. Mitigation: when Sebastian opens a Claude Code session, confirm `cwd` is `mog-mobile`, not `Master-Ordering-Guide`.
- **No CI** — the only verification of a deploy is Sebastian opening the live URL. Workable for a 1-operator setup but means PRs from anyone else would have no safety net. Not urgent.
- **`python3` shim hijack on Windows** — the Microsoft Store stub intercepts `python3`. Use `python` or `py` instead. `build.py`'s shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3` only matters on Unix.
- **PowerShell PATH staleness post-install.** After a `winget install`, in-session shells don't pick up new tools until PATH is refreshed from registry. The convention in `CLAUDE.md` covers this.

---

## Architecture notes worth remembering

- **Two separate `CACHE_VERSION` constants** — one in `sw.js` (hub) and one in `template/sw.js` (per-store). They move independently. Bump only the one whose shell actually changed.
- **`build.py` is idempotent and zero-arg.** Running it without changes is a no-op. `--dry-run` previews without writing.
- **`apps-script/deploy.ps1` writes a temporary `.clasp.json` per target, runs `clasp push -f`, then cleans up.** `.clasp.json` is gitignored. Don't try to maintain a permanent one — the deploy script owns that file.
- **The 6 store-bound HTML modal files (AdminReset, ManageItems, ManageVendors, OrderHistory, ReorderPickPath, StorageAreas, HowToUse) plus the 2 `.gs` files are all `apps-script/` peers.** No subdirectory structure inside `apps-script/`. Clasp's default file picker handles this fine.
- **`apps-script/.clasp-targets.json` is committed to git** with real Script IDs. Script IDs are project identifiers, not secrets — pushing still requires OAuth (`clasp login`) on the user's side. Committing makes the deploy workflow portable to a fresh machine.
- **The `STORE_REGISTRY` build-injection marker** in root `index.html` is the line containing `// __STORE_REGISTRY__ build-injected`. Exactly one such line; `build.py` fails loud otherwise.
- **rpr's `appsscript.json` was chosen as canonical** during 2026-05-24 reconciliation because it explicitly declared OAuth scopes (the other 5 stores had implicit/auto-detected scopes). The canonical manifest is now applied to all 9 targets.
